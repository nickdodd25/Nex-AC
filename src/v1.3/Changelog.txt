Changes:
* Added "#define USE_QUERY" (true by default)
 * If your server is under Brute-force attack - for better protection USE_QUERY value can be changed to false
 * Attention! If false, the server will not display the information in the server browser, so use in extreme cases!
* Added features IsAntiCheatEnabled and IsAntiCheatEnabledForPlayer

Fixes:
* Fixed load anticheat configuration from config-file
* Increased some values in favor of players with high ping
* Rcon protection (against Brute-force) now also dynamically enabled/disabled by function EnableAntiCheat
* Fixed minor bugs in the anti-cheats on ammo hack, RapidFire, SpeedHack in vehicle, Anti-GodMode on foot and in vehicle
